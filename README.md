# Vector Image Tutorial

## Author: Cameron Patton - cptgk

### Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial is to help familiarize general audiences on how to create their own vector graphic images. This tutorial does not require a lot of technical know-how, but does require some precision and patience with a mouse, tablet, or any other input device. Included in this tutorial is a guided video walkthrough showing the process of creating your own vector images.

### Disclaimer
I will be using Adobe Illustrator and a mouse-drawn technique throughout this tutorial, so the process and/or layout may look different if you are using an alternative software.
