# Vector Image Tutorial

## Author: Cameron Patton - cptgk

### Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial is to help familiarize general audiences on how to create their own vector graphic images. This tutorial does not require a lot of technical know-how, but does require some precision and patience with a mouse, tablet, or any other input device. Included in this tutorial is a guided video walkthrough showing the process of creating your own vector images. My target audience includes both newcomers and experts in graphic design looking to create vector images using my easy-to-follow tutorial!

### Disclaimer
I will be using Adobe Illustrator and a mouse-drawn technique throughout this tutorial, so the process and/or layout may look different if you are using an alternative software. Also, since Markdown does not support uploading videos, clicking on the below thumbnail image will lead you to the YouTube video.
